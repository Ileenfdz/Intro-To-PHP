    $num1 = 5;
    $num2 = 10;

    $num1 === 5 and $num2 === 10;
    Shorthand
    $num1 === 5 && $num2 === 10;

    $num1 === 5 or $num2 === 10;
    Shorthand
    $num1 === 5 || $num2 === 10;

    $num1 === 5 xor $num2 === 10; Only one has to be true, just one

    !$num1 === 6; Is it false?
*/

/*Increment/Decrement:
    $num1 = 5;
    ++$num1; Increments, output 6
    $num1++; Nothing, outputs 5

    --$num1; Increments, output 4
    $num1--; Nothing, outputs 5
